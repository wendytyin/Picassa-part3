A Guide to Expressions, the package, the royal kingdom of OOP.

Expression.java is the super-est class. Respect your ancestor. 

ParenExpression and TerminalExpression are its two progeny. One is rather chubbier than the other, 
as he/she/it has to keep track of his/her/its many mini-me's, and the stress of doing so puts on the 
pounds. The other is rather narcissistic and a harbinger of the apocalypse.

Each of the mini-me's contain an identification card, also known as "myCommand" for use 
in the identification and construction factories of mini-me's (except for Number...Number is a little 
bit "special" and needs extra help), a parsing unit for consuming strings, 
and an evaluation unit, for when the mini-me's are fully grown and ready for harvesting. Additionally 
they have the option to pull on their bigger-me's coattails to get their messages across.

Finally, the royal ExpressionFactory. It is staffed by rather dumb but loyal servants, unquestioningly 
pulling levers and passing messages.
